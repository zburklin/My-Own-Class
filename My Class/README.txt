WELCOME TO MY OWN CLASS!
By Zane Burklin :)



SUMMARY:
This small program is designed to make a class based off of bread. There are many types of bread out there, which is why making a simple class is applicable. This class utilizes qualities of bread like how much it costs and how fresh it is. It also has functions that take those variables and uses them to print messages based on what the variables are.



VARIABLES:

name
This variable exists as an defining input for the Bread Class. It is meant to be the type of bread.

days_old
This bariable is another defining input that takes in how old the bread is.

self.name
This variable is a privatized version of name.

self.days_old
See above.

cost
Cost is a variable that can be inputted with a bread object to assign the cost of that specific bread type.

self.cost
Privatized version of cost.

x
This variable is a test variable for my methods.



METHODS:

__init__
This method constructs the bread object, taking in the name and age of the bread instance.

get_days
This method prints the age of the bread.

set_self
This method takes in a number and sets that number as the cost of the bread.

determine_expensive
This method uses if statements to determine if the bread is considered expensive or not.

buy_or_nah
This method determines whether it is advisable to buy the bread object by using elements of the object in if statements.

main
This function runs all of the code I've created.



DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to construct objects of the bread class based on their type and age. Once said object is constructed, several methods are created. These methods range from adding a variable to the object that determines it's cost to advising whether the bread should be bought or not.

HOW TO RUN:
This program doesn't need any external programs to run, and will run on it's own with the test variable x. If you would like to interact with it, you can create variables in the main function that utitilize the bread class. Remember to specify the type and how old the bread is as parameters (in days).
